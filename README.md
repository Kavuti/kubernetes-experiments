# kubernetes-experiments
My personal Kubernetes experiments in a single repository.

All the examples are based on some courses I'm taking myself (both payed and free) in order to have an introduction to the basic knowledge and usage of Kubernetes.
Feel free to give advices or comment anything that figures strange to you.
